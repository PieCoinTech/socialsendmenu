Social sending pie menu

This repo contains the menu code for the PieCoin social sending front-end.

It is based on code snippets from here:

http://dabblet.com/gist/3912488

And inspired by the concepts here:

http://pmg.softwaretailoring.net

This is the interface for the sending options.

Further logic and deeper functionality is to be developed and added to this repo and others.

Standard issue fork and request so we can build more through community support.
